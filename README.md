## Overview

“Like the offspring of Crypto Twitter and a Bloomberg Terminal”

AEGIS, an AI-enabled gateway for Solana intelligence, aims to streamline the cryptocurrency research process. By utilizing a team of specialized research agents and an execution agent (Wexley), AEGIS provides users with the information needed to make informed investment decisions quickly. This roadmap outlines the current features of AEGIS and proposes future enhancements to achieve autonomous research and personalized analysis flows. 


## Current Features

- **Multi-Agent Analysis System**: Specialized AI agents collaborate to analyze different aspects of tokens:
  - On-chain metrics analysis
  - Social sentiment tracking
  - Technical analysis
  - Risk assessment
  - Market dynamics evaluation

- **Wexley - Your AI Trading Companion**: 
  - Natural language trading execution
  - Real-time chart analysis
  - Twitter sentiment integration
  - Trade execution via GMGN
  - Degenerate yet data-driven insights

- **Advanced Trading Capabilities**:
  - Natural language trade commands (e.g., "buy 1 sol", "sell half")
  - GMGN integration for optimal execution
  - Real-time price feeds
  - Automated trade execution


# Research Agents: Specialized AI agents focus on specific domains (social sentiment, on-chain data, technical analysis) to generate a comprehensive score for a given cryptocurrency.

# Wexley (Execution Agent): 
Translates natural language commands into blockchain actions (buying, selling) based on the research agents' findings. Wexley can also break down complex metrics into an easily understandable format. Wexley is the communication point between the user and the metrics generated in the analysis by the research agents.

# Combined Intelligence:
Research agents collaborate to provide a holistic view of a cryptocurrency's potential.
User-Friendly Interface: Presents research findings in a format that is quick and easy to understand. Saving users time and often money. Execution panel available for those that prefer manual trading.
